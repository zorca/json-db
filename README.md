json-db is a document oriented database using json files as storage.

It tries to implement concurrency proofness with unit of work mechanism, but has not been tested yet in heavy
load environments. Documents are retrieved with a query pattern.

## Installation

```
composer require zorca/json-db
```

## Usage

```php
use JsonDb\JsonDb;
use JsonDb\JsonCollection;

$db = new JsonDb('some/dir/in/your/filesystem');

// Lets get a collection
$test = $db->getCollection('test');
$test = $db->test; // That's the same

// Insert something
$something = array('foo' => 'bar');
$test->insert($something); // Adds a _id to $something, mongo style.

// Get all documents
$all = $test->find();

// Get one or more documents with condition
$some = $test->find(Query::match('foo','bar'));
$some = $test->find(Query::match('foo','bar')->or(Query::match('yay', 'blah')));

// Update a record
$something['aze'] = 'rty';
$test->update(Query::match('foo','bar'), $something);

// Deleting a record works the same way
$test->delete(Query::match('foo','bar'));

// If you want flush changes to filesystem, just use flush
$test->flush();

// When you're done, drop the collection erases it all.
$test->drop();
```
